# KK-Studio v1.4.2 Coordination Status

Last updated: 2026-05-02

## Active State

- Active lane in this thread: Stage One M6 ecommerce runtime extraction, current slice `useEcommerceBuildRuntime`.
- Clay UI audit closure landed in `9e7ae2b5` and is no longer the active lane.
- Current branch: `main`.
- Plain `.git` still reports `4c448660`; the writable full Git metadata copy at `node_modules/.codex-git-full` is ahead of plain metadata and was at `017bb3a2` before this build-runtime commit. Use `git --git-dir=node_modules/.codex-git-full --work-tree=.` for status/staging/commits in this session.
- Plain `.git` and the writable full Git metadata copy can both show mixed historical runtime/PPT/ecommerce work during this thread. Staging must remain path-limited and use the writable metadata copy.
- UI source of truth: `C:/Users/Administrator/Downloads/DESIGN-clay.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `.agent/rules/skills/SKILL.md`, and shared CSS tokens in `src/index.css`.
- Runtime source of truth: Stage One hook extraction rules in `plans.md`; all custom hooks stay under `src/app/` with explicit deps/result interfaces.
- Current focus: close the ecommerce build runtime slice with full validation and a path-limited runtime commit. Clay UI files remain excluded from this runtime commit.

## Completed In `9e7ae2b5` (Clay UI Audit Closure)

- User override remains active: inputs, main cards, sub cards, and framework cards must use controlled frosted material; dark mode must use neutral black/gray surfaces, not teal/blue/indigo canvas.
- Fixed in this pass: Profile Modal action list/security surfaces, toolbar selected tokens, TagInputModal shell/input/footer, ProjectManager dropdown/modal sub surfaces, ChatSidebar message/attachment sub surfaces, PromptBar sky/white-glass skeleton and drag placeholder surfaces, mobile framework shell glass aliases, mobile advanced drawer white-glass utilities, mobile card index/empty/badge blue surfaces, EcommerceImportPanel hover glass, SearchPalette multi-select readability, RechargeModal dark CTA readability, API Workspace nested-card reduction, ChatSidebar agent active state, and PromptNode violet/blue badge drift.
- Light-theme readability was hardened by adding readable Clay emphasis text tokens (`--clay-brand-pink-ink`, `--clay-brand-coral-ink`) while keeping brand pink/coral for tinted fills and borders.
- Contract coverage now includes frosted input/main/sub/framework tokens, neutral black-gray dark variables, readable light emphasis text on tinted states, toolbar selected tokens, ProjectManager sub surfaces, ChatSidebar message/attachment surfaces, TagInputModal frosted tokens, PromptBar stale blue/white-glass regressions, mobile shell and mobile badge/index regressions, ecommerce hover token use, SearchPalette multi-select token use, RechargeModal CTA readability, API Workspace reduced nesting, ChatSidebar active-state token use, and PromptNode badge color regressions.
- Browser QA for this lane is complete and tracked below.
- Commit scope was UI/doc/test only and explicitly excluded runtime/PPT/ecommerce extraction WIP.

## Current Ecommerce Build Runtime Pass

- Extracted ecommerce analysis confirmation, framework/group/task node building, initial group slot creation, upload-reference caching for newly built cards, and framework runtime bootstrapping into `src/app/useEcommerceBuildRuntime.ts`.
- `src/App.tsx` now wires the build runtime through `updateEcommerceBuildRuntimeState`; App no longer owns inline `buildEcommerceFrameworkNode`, `buildEcommerceGroupNode`, `buildEcommercePromptNode`, or `handleConfirmEcommerceAnalysis`.
- Existing upload-sync and generation/scheduler runtime paths remain in `App.tsx` / `useEcommerceRuntime` for this slice; the build hook returns only `handleConfirmEcommerceAnalysis`.
- Subagent review confirmed the slice ownership boundary. Its P3 notification-control-flow concern was fixed by isolating success/failure notification delivery from build state transitions.
- New contract coverage in `tests/unit/ecommerce-build-runtime-contract.test.ts` covers hook ownership, explicit deps/result interfaces, current upload-reference caching, canvas group layout, group slot initialization, framework runtime initialization, success/failure notifications, App wiring, and separation from upload sync/generation runtime.
- Existing confirm-flow, group-shell, slot-integration, analysis-selection, and upload-sync source contracts were retargeted so build creation details are asserted in `src/app/useEcommerceBuildRuntime.ts`, while `src/App.tsx` remains responsible for wiring, upload-sync effects, and hidden-node rendering filters.
- The new contract test is included in `tsconfig.tests.json`.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 5353 physical lines; `src/app/useEcommerceBuildRuntime.ts` 617 physical lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-build-runtime-contract.test.ts` 51 physical lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-confirm-build-flow.test.ts` 39 physical lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-analysis-selection-contract.test.ts` 22 physical lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-references-contract.test.ts` 238 physical lines; `tsconfig.tests.json` 49 physical lines.
- Targeted validation: `node --import ./scripts/test/set-log-level.mjs --test --test-isolation=none tests/unit/ecommerce-build-runtime-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-confirm-build-flow.test.ts` passed (4/4).
- Broadened ecommerce build/upload/group-shell validation: `node --import ./scripts/test/set-log-level.mjs --test --test-isolation=none tests/unit/ecommerce-build-runtime-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-confirm-build-flow.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-upload-sync-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-slot-integration.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-shell-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-shell-app-contract.test.ts` passed (8/8) after retargeting stale App-inline assertions.
- Broadened active validation with analysis-selection/upload-reference/model/task/runtime contracts: `node --import ./scripts/test/set-log-level.mjs --test --test-isolation=none tests/unit/ecommerce-build-runtime-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-confirm-build-flow.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-upload-sync-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-slot-integration.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-shell-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-shell-app-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-analysis-selection-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-references-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-model-policy.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-task-services.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-contract.test.ts` passed (36/36).
- Passed: `npm.cmd run typecheck`; test semantic check now covers 20 files via `tsconfig.tests.json`.
- Passed: `npm.cmd run test:unit` (1098/1098).
- Passed: `npm.cmd run build`.
- Passed: `npm.cmd run governance:agent-docs`.
- Passed: `npm.cmd run check:encoding`.
- Passed tracked diff check: `git --git-dir=node_modules/.codex-git-full --work-tree=. diff --check -- src/App.tsx src/app/useEcommerceBuildRuntime.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-build-runtime-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-confirm-build-flow.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-upload-sync-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-slot-integration.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-shell-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-group-shell-app-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-analysis-selection-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-references-contract.test.ts tsconfig.tests.json status.md plans.md implement.md validation.md` with LF/CRLF normalization warnings only.
- Passed staged diff check after path-limited staging: `git --git-dir=node_modules/.codex-git-full --work-tree=. diff --cached --check`.
- Passed staged diff check after path-limited staging: `git --git-dir=node_modules/.codex-git-full --work-tree=. diff --cached --check`.
- Browser QA: skipped for this slice because it is non-UI runtime build glue. The Clay UI lane browser evidence remains recorded below.
- Commit include scope for this runtime slice: `status.md`, `plans.md`, `implement.md`, `validation.md`, `tsconfig.tests.json`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/app/useEcommerceBuildRuntime.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-build-runtime-contract.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-confirm-build-flow.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-upload-sync-contract.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-group-slot-integration.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-group-shell-contract.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-group-shell-app-contract.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-analysis-selection-contract.test.ts`, and `tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-references-contract.test.ts`.

## Completed In `017bb3a2` (Ecommerce Requirement Analysis Runtime)

- Extracted requirement-file pick, requirement clear, analysis reset, empty group slots, selected-item derivation, product-image AI enhancement data preparation, and requirement analysis execution into `src/app/useEcommerceRequirementAnalysisRuntime.ts`.
- `src/App.tsx` now wires the runtime through `updateEcommerceRequirementAnalysisState`; App no longer owns inline `createEcommerceAnalysisResetPatch`, `handlePickEcommerceRequirementFile`, `handleClearEcommerceRequirementFile`, `handleResetEcommerceAnalysis`, or `handleAnalyzeEcommerceRequirement`.
- `App.tsx` injects `analyzeEcommerceRequirementFile` through the hook's explicit dependency interface; App no longer owns the async analysis body or calls the analyzer directly inside inline handlers.
- The async analysis flow is executable through exported `runEcommerceRequirementAnalysis`, which keeps the hook thin and lets tests cover no-file warnings, analyzing/success/failure patches, AI enhancement data conversion, partial analyzer-result normalization, success notifications, and reference-preserving patch behavior.
- `handleGenerate` now includes `ecommerceState.analysis`, `handleAnalyzeEcommerceRequirement`, and `handleConfirmEcommerceAnalysis` in its dependency array so ecommerce submit does not keep stale no-file or stale-confirm closures.
- New contract coverage in `tests/unit/ecommerce-requirement-analysis-runtime-contract.test.ts` covers hook ownership, explicit deps/result interfaces, analysis reset and clear patch behavior, empty group slots, analysis counts, default selected items for main/A+ rows, product image data extraction, success and failure patch behavior, no-file warning, AI enhancement success, AI enhancement failure fallback, partial analyzer-result defaults, and ecommerce submit callback dependencies. Existing analysis button and upload removal source contracts were retargeted to hook ownership.
- The new contract test plus the retargeted ecommerce analysis-button and upload-removal tests are included in `tsconfig.tests.json`, so `npm.cmd run typecheck` now semantically checks 17 test files.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 5760 physical lines; `src/app/useEcommerceRequirementAnalysisRuntime.ts` 317 physical lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-requirement-analysis-runtime-contract.test.ts` 455 physical lines.
- Subagent review: source audit identified stale ecommerce submit dependencies, analyzer ownership drift, a P1 optional-collection dereference in the success notification, and P2 gaps for clear/AI fallback behavior coverage. The submit dependencies were fixed, analyzer execution is dependency-injected through the hook interface, partial analysis results are normalized inside the hook, and the runtime contract now executes clear, success, failure, AI fallback, and partial-result paths.
- Browser QA: skipped for this slice because it is non-UI runtime analysis glue. The Clay UI lane browser evidence remains recorded below.
- Commit include scope for this runtime slice: `status.md`, `plans.md`, `implement.md`, `validation.md`, `tsconfig.tests.json`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/app/useEcommerceRequirementAnalysisRuntime.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-requirement-analysis-runtime-contract.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-analysis-button-gate.test.ts`, and `tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-removal-contract.test.ts`.

## Completed In `bd265ec9` (Ecommerce Task State Runtime)

- Extracted initial ecommerce task-state building and task edit synchronization into `src/app/useEcommerceTaskStateRuntime.ts`.
- `src/App.tsx` now wires `useEcommerceTaskStateRuntime` through the narrow `updateEcommerceTaskStateRuntimeState` adapter; App no longer owns the inline `buildInitialEcommerceTaskStates` or `handleChangeEcommerceTaskState` callbacks.
- New contract coverage in `tests/unit/ecommerce-task-state-runtime-contract.test.ts` covers hook ownership, explicit deps/result interfaces, source-row keyed initial state, effective sizing application, stored task updates by row key or task id, active draft updates by task id, and no-op behavior when nothing matches.
- The new contract test is included in `tsconfig.tests.json`, so `npm.cmd run typecheck` now semantically checks 14 test files instead of 13.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 5843 physical lines; `src/app/useEcommerceTaskStateRuntime.ts` 124 physical lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-task-state-runtime-contract.test.ts` 232 physical lines.
- Subagent review: spec compliance review passed with no findings. Code-quality review found no runtime blockers; its P2 staging warning is addressed by including the new hook/test in the same commit, and its P3 test-typecheck warning was fixed by adding the test to `tsconfig.tests.json`.
- Browser QA: skipped for this slice because it is non-UI runtime task-state glue. The Clay UI lane browser evidence remains recorded below.
- Commit include scope for this runtime slice: `status.md`, `plans.md`, `implement.md`, `validation.md`, `tsconfig.tests.json`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/app/useEcommerceTaskStateRuntime.ts`, and `tests/unit/ecommerce-task-state-runtime-contract.test.ts`.

## Completed In `9cb4d2c4` (Ecommerce Sheet Settings Runtime)

- Extracted ecommerce sheet defaults, A+ control mode resolution, effective task sizing, node generation settings, and sheet-setting updates into `src/app/useEcommerceSheetSettingsRuntime.ts`.
- `src/App.tsx` now wires the hook through `useEcommerceSheetSettingsRuntime` and adapts `setEcommerceState` through `updateEcommerceSheetSettingsState`, keeping App as orchestration and prop wiring.
- Existing prompt bar ecommerce footer contract was retargeted so sheet settings defaults and A+ 4K enforcement are owned by the hook instead of inline App helpers.
- New contract coverage in `tests/unit/ecommerce-sheet-settings-runtime-contract.test.ts` covers hook ownership, explicit deps/result interfaces, default sheet settings, A+ sizing policy behavior, and desktop/mobile generation target resolution. Existing prompt-bar and prompt-optimizer source contracts were retargeted away from removed inline App helpers.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 5877 physical lines; `src/app/useEcommerceSheetSettingsRuntime.ts` 351 physical lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-sheet-settings-runtime-contract.test.ts` 168 physical lines.
- Review note: `App.tsx` still imports the hook file's exported `createDefaultEcommerceSheetSettings` helper for initial state and node-build fallbacks because those paths run before or outside the hook invocation. The inline App implementations were removed; strict helper-call removal is deferred until a broader ecommerce analysis/node-build runtime boundary owns those call sites.
- Browser QA: skipped for this slice because it is non-UI runtime sheet-setting glue. The Clay UI lane browser evidence remains recorded below.
- Commit include scope for this runtime slice: `status.md`, `plans.md`, `implement.md`, `validation.md`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/app/useEcommerceSheetSettingsRuntime.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-sheet-settings-runtime-contract.test.ts`, `tests/unit/prompt-bar-ecommerce-footer-controls.test.ts`, and `tests/unit/prompt-optimizer-service-source-contract.test.ts`.
- Explicitly excluded dirty UI paths: none in the writable metadata after `9e7ae2b5`; if plain `.git` still reports UI files, those belong to the metadata mismatch and must not be staged through plain `.git`.

## Completed In `ec434f94` (Paused Runtime/Ecommerce Lane)

- Ecommerce framework runtime state/view helpers route through `src/app/useEcommerceFrameworkRuntimeState.ts`.
- Extracted state/view boundary: `ecommerceFrameworkRuntimeRef`, `resolveEcommerceFrameworkId`, `updateEcommerceFrameworkRuntime`, `syncEcommerceFrameworkView`, and `handleActivateEcommerceGroupSheet`.
- `src/app/useEcommerceRuntime.ts` now consumes a single `frameworkStateView` boundary object instead of individual App inline deps for framework runtime state/view.
- Contract hardening: `tests/unit/ecommerce-framework-runtime-state-contract.test.ts` covers hook existence, explicit deps/result interfaces, App ordering, runtime-before-state ordering, sync-before-meta ordering, and the preserved `GenerationMode.ECOMMERCE` framework filter. `tests/unit/ecommerce-framework-runtime-order.test.ts` now targets the extracted hook.
- RED evidence: framework state/view contract tests failed before the hook existed and before `useEcommerceRuntime` consumed `frameworkStateView`; the ecommerce-mode filter assertion failed before restoring the original guard.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 6484 lines; `src/app/useEcommerceFrameworkRuntimeState.ts` 240 lines; `src/app/useEcommerceRuntime.ts` 385 lines.
- Subagent review: spec and code-quality reviewers found the extracted boundary shape correct. A P2 mode-filter regression was fixed before commit; a P3 order-test gap was tightened before final validation.
- Browser QA was skipped for this slice because it was non-UI runtime state/view glue. This current UI thread owns the required browser evidence for Clay surfaces.
- The runtime/ecommerce lane is paused again and must stay out of the UI commit.

## Completed In `cf34f12b` (Ecommerce Upload Reference Runtime)

- Extracted upload/reference binding runtime into `src/app/useEcommerceUploadReferenceRuntime.ts`.
- New hook owns upload/reference identity helpers, `ReferenceImage` construction from uploads/assets, reference signatures, product image ref derivation, manual reference lookup, and product/extra/item pick/remove handlers.
- `src/App.tsx` now wires hook results through `useEcommerceUploadReferenceRuntime`, while requirement file handlers, confirm flow, and the built-card upload sync effect remain in `App.tsx`.
- Behavior preserved: image-only upload filtering, append-with-cap for product/extra/item references (`4/4/6`), file identity format `labelPrefix-sanitizedName-size-lastModified`, base64 payload extraction, full data URL retention, first-product-only `productImageRef`, and manual binding lookup by `taskStateSeed.sourceRowKey`.
- Review follow-up completed: `extractEcommerceManualReferenceBindings` now depends only on `itemReferenceFiles`, and no-op removal handlers return `null` instead of widening state churn. Empty per-item manual reference buckets are removed after the final item is deleted.
- Contract hardening: `tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-references-contract.test.ts` covers hook ownership, exported deps/result interfaces, helper behavior, no-op removal guards, and empty bucket cleanup. Existing upload removal and built-card sync contracts were retargeted from App inline ownership to hook ownership.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 5644 lines; `src/app/useEcommerceUploadReferenceRuntime.ts` 299 lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-references-contract.test.ts` 214 lines.
- Browser QA: skipped for this slice because it is non-UI runtime upload/reference glue. The active Clay UI lane owns browser evidence for Clay surfaces.
- Commit include scope was `status.md`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/app/useEcommerceUploadReferenceRuntime.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-references-contract.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-removal-contract.test.ts`, and `tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-upload-sync-contract.test.ts`.

## Completed In `9b0f7dd3` (Ecommerce Group Export Runtime)

- Extracted ecommerce group export and slot-result synchronization into `src/app/useEcommerceGroupExportRuntime.ts`.
- New hook owns `sanitizeEcommerceExportName`, latest slot image resolution, group slot sync via `applyEcommerceSlotResult`, manifest construction via `buildEcommerceGroupExportManifest`, zip packaging, dynamic file-saver invocation, no-export warning, fallback-quality warning, and success notification.
- `src/App.tsx` now injects `activeCanvas`, `activeCanvasRef`, `ecommerceState`, `setEcommerceGroupExportState`, and `resolvePptImageBlob`, then only wires `handleExportEcommerceGroup` into prompt node props.
- Behavior preserved: default latest-image lookup still considers all delivery kinds when no `deliveryKind` is provided; `desktop-then-mobile` still records independent desktop/mobile deliverables; no generated deliverables still warn instead of exporting an empty zip; file-name sanitization preserves the previous replacement behavior.
- Hardening completed: file-saver is now dynamically imported through a CJS/ESM-compatible adapter for direct Node contract imports; `buildNextEcommerceGroupSlots` normalizes missing slot arrays, selected item maps, and delivery arrays before iterating.
- Contract updates: `tests/unit/ecommerce-group-export-runtime-contract.test.ts` covers hook ownership and pure helper behavior. Existing export entry, slot integration, ecommerce canvas, and no-export guard tests were retargeted from App inline ownership to hook ownership.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 6062 lines; `src/app/useEcommerceGroupExportRuntime.ts` 365 lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-group-export-runtime-contract.test.ts` 182 lines.
- Subagent review: governance review confirmed this slice should stay path-limited and avoid UI lane files. Code-quality review found no P1/P2 blockers, noted the default delivery semantics and runtime nullish hardening, and left a P3 follow-up to upgrade the no-export guard from source regex to behavior-level coverage later. The default behavior was kept as historical behavior, and the nullish hardening was applied.
- Browser QA: skipped for this slice because it is non-UI runtime export glue. The active Clay UI lane owns browser evidence for visual surfaces.
- Commit include scope for this runtime slice: `status.md`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/app/useEcommerceGroupExportRuntime.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-group-export-runtime-contract.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-group-export-entry.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-group-slot-integration.test.ts`, `tests/unit/ecommerce-canvas-contract.test.ts`, and `tests/unit/ecommerce-export-button-guards.test.ts`.
- Explicitly excluded dirty UI paths: `plans.md`, `implement.md`, `validation.md`, `.agent/rules/skills/SKILL.md`, `src/app/AppDesktopChrome.tsx`, `src/components/**`, `src/index.css`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/workflow/nodes/WorkflowUtilityCard.tsx`, and Clay/theme UI tests.

## Completed In `be63eda2`

- Ecommerce selection actions now route through `src/app/useEcommerceRuntime.ts`, with pure state helpers in `src/app/ecommerceSelectionRuntime.ts`.
- Extracted actions: `handleToggleEcommerceAnalysisSelection`, `handleToggleEcommerceSelected`, and `handleSetEcommerceGroupSelection`.
- Contract hardening: `tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-contract.test.ts` asserts selection handler ownership and App wiring; `tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-selection.test.ts` verifies selected item and group slot synchronization.
- RED evidence: selection ownership and pure helper tests failed before hook/helper implementation; they passed after extraction and the narrowed `updateEcommerceSelectionState` dependency.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 6658 lines; `src/app/useEcommerceRuntime.ts` 390 lines; `src/app/ecommerceSelectionRuntime.ts` 101 lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-selection.test.ts` 119 lines.
- Validation passed before commit: targeted ecommerce selection tests (11/11), `npm.cmd run typecheck`, `npm.cmd run test:unit` (1066/1066), `npm.cmd run build`, `npm.cmd run governance:agent-docs`, `npm.cmd run check:encoding`, and targeted `git diff --check`.

## Completed In `294b0d3e`

- `src/app/useEcommerceRuntime.ts` owns the ecommerce framework scheduler actions previously inline in `src/App.tsx`.
- Extracted actions: `resolveEcommerceFrameworkQueuePhases`, `enqueueEcommerceFrameworkNodes`, `pumpEcommerceFrameworkQueue`, `handleGenerateEcommerceFramework`, `handlePauseEcommerceFramework`, `handleResumeEcommerceFramework`, `handleCancelEcommerceFrameworkNodeQueue`, and `handleGenerateEcommerceGroup`.
- Contract hardening: `tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-contract.test.ts` asserts hook ownership, explicit deps/result interfaces, and App wiring; `tests/unit/ecommerce-button-guards.test.ts` follows the no-eligible-card warning contract from the hook.
- Line counts after extraction: `src/App.tsx` 6716 lines; `src/app/useEcommerceRuntime.ts` 341 lines; `tests/unit/ecommerce-runtime-contract.test.ts` 44 lines.
- Validation passed before commit: targeted ecommerce framework tests (10/10), `npm.cmd run typecheck`, `npm.cmd run test:unit` (1065/1065), `npm.cmd run build`, `npm.cmd run governance:agent-docs`, `npm.cmd run check:encoding`, and targeted `git diff --check`.

## Completed In `92abdacf`

- Hardened PPT runtime export ordering so `handleExportPptx`, `handleExportPptPackage`, and `handleExportPptSinglePage` route through `getOrderedPptNodeBundle`.
- Updated `tests/unit/ppt-runtime-contract.test.ts` to reject direct `getPromptPptImageNodes` usage in `src/app/usePptRuntime.ts`.
- Validation passed before commit: targeted PPT/runtime contracts, `npm.cmd run typecheck`, `npm.cmd run test:unit` (1064/1064), `npm.cmd run build`, `npm.cmd run governance:agent-docs`, `npm.cmd run check:encoding`, and `git diff --check` with CRLF normalization warnings only.

## Completed In `4c448660`

### Clay UI

- Clay design and rule docs were reconciled with `DESIGN-clay.md` and the user override for controlled frosted material.
- Shared tokens were added for neutral dark surfaces and frosted inputs, main cards, sub cards, and framework cards.
- Dark mode now targets neutral black-gray surfaces: `#0b0b0c`, `#141414`, and `#1f1f1f`.
- Major UI surfaces were moved onto the shared material system: search palette, sidebar, prompt/composer inputs, mobile shell, settings, storage modal, ecommerce panels, and canvas/image cards.
- Contract coverage includes controlled frosted tokens, neutral dark aliases, legacy blue-black token regressions, ecommerce frosted surfaces, mobile workspace surfaces, and theme contrast.

### Runtime / PPT Boundary Work

- `src/App.tsx` was reduced to 6210 lines in the committed baseline.
- `src/app/useGenerationRuntime.ts` owns generation runtime orchestration and related retry/billing contracts.
- `src/app/usePptRuntime.ts` owns PPT runtime orchestration.
- `src/app/pptRuntimeHelpers.ts` centralizes PPT image ordering, stale child fallback, parent prompt rejection, deck child detection, and nullish image array guards.
- PPT and generation runtime contracts were expanded in the same committed baseline.

Historical validation for `017bb3a2` ecommerce requirement analysis runtime pass:

- RED evidence: `node --import ./scripts/test/set-log-level.mjs --test --test-isolation=none tests/unit/ecommerce-requirement-analysis-runtime-contract.test.ts` failed first on missing `runEcommerceRequirementAnalysis` export.
- RED evidence: the ecommerce submit dependency contract failed first because the `handleGenerate` dependency list omitted `ecommerceState.analysis`, `handleAnalyzeEcommerceRequirement`, and `handleConfirmEcommerceAnalysis`.
- Passed after implementation: `node --import ./scripts/test/set-log-level.mjs --test --test-isolation=none tests/unit/ecommerce-requirement-analysis-runtime-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-analysis-button-gate.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-upload-removal-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-task-state-runtime-contract.test.ts tests/unit/ecommerce-confirm-build-flow.test.ts` (22/22).

## Browser QA

- Browser QA is complete for the active Clay UI lane before the UI commit.
- Current browser target: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/?clayVerify=requestlog20260501` served from the local production/static path after `npm.cmd run build`.
- Theme and viewport checked: dark theme, mobile-width in-app Browser viewport; final refresh captured a visible viewport of about `872x985`; desktop/settings/search/API workbench surfaces were also inspected during the same pass.
- Verified surfaces: mobile shell, prompt/composer, SearchPalette default and multi-select states, settings overview, and API Workspace.
- Browser findings: dark mode reads as neutral black/gray; SearchPalette multi-select is readable; API Workspace Add API/Setup Status no longer render as nested stacked cards; `.theme-transitioning === 0`; stale chunk text count `0`.
- Light-theme readability is covered by the Clay emphasis contrast contract because the in-app Browser pass could not switch theme through the blocked `javascript:` injection path.

## Remaining Work

1. Stage and commit only the current runtime slice files plus ledger updates through `git --git-dir=node_modules/.codex-git-full --work-tree=.`.
2. Keep completed Clay UI files and unrelated runtime/PPT WIP out of the build-runtime commit.
3. Continue Stage One M6 with the next ecommerce runtime slice after the build-runtime commit lands.

## Risks

- Original `.git` does not match the writable metadata copy in this session. Use the full writable metadata copy at `node_modules/.codex-git-full` for local commits unless the ACL is fixed outside the sandbox.
- The worktree remains mixed, so any staging must be explicit path-based and reviewed before commit.
- Do not delete locks, change `.git` ACLs, revert paused runtime/PPT work, or stage unrelated runtime files without explicit user confirmation.
